# The-Least-Common-Multiple-LCM-and-Greatest-Common-Divisor-GCD-Calculator
The Least Common Multiple ( LCM ) is also referred to as the Lowest Common Multiple ( LCM ) and Least Common Divisor ( LCD) . For two integers a and b, denoted LCM(a,b), the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both a and b. For example, LCM(2,3) = 6 and LCM(6,10) = 30. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two positive integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without remainder. It is useful for reducing fractions to be in its lowest terms.
